# <Pre-Work-Study-Guide>

## Description

The purpose was to get my feet wet pushing some html and javascript.  This helped me learn and progress in my coding goal. I learned how CSS and HTML function and how to link them.  Also debugged some nasty syntax errors. 



## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Just copy the code into your local machine,  Use an IDE pull up code.  Navigate to index.html, right click and select Run in Browser.  

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![screenshot](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

Thanks for Berkeley bootcamp for showing me the way
